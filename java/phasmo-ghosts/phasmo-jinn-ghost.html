          <p>EVIDENCE: EMF5, Fingerprints, Thermometer</p>
          <p>Hunt Threshold: 50% (only target sanity)</p>
          <p>Speed:  2.5m/s (fusebox on, LoS to player, far away). 1.6m/s </p>
          <p>Hidden Ability: May reduce the Sanity of nearby players by 25% IF the Breaker is on
          </p>
          <p>Give Away: Hunt: Quickly jumps closer to players in sight</p>
          <p> Exclude: Turned off the Breaker (directly)</p>
          <p>
            Hunt: The Jinn's ability to reduce your Sanity, will give an EMF reading at the breaker.
            Speed is determined by Breaker State and Line of Sight to the Player.

          <h3 class="subheading">Trivia</h3>
          <p>
            Jinns are derived from Arabic mythology, and were later integrated as part of Islamic theology. They are a type of spirit/being created before mankind out of smoke-free fire. Usually invisible, they can take shape in many forms including serpents, winged beings, giants, insects, or humanoids. Jinns are not undead, and they live, eat, age, and have children like humans. Like mankind, they were made to worship God, and they are not innately good nor innately evil.</p>
          <h3 class="subheading">Lore</h3>
          <p class="info">
            „A Jinn is a territorial ghost that will attack when threatened. It has also been known to be able to travel at significant speed.”
