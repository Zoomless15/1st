          <p> Hunt: Mylings being quieter during hunts refers ONLY to the footstep sound. It is shorter than the Electrics malfunction range. So sit in a hiding space with a flashlight on the ground, if you hear the footsteps (on the same level) before the flashlight goes off, it's a Myling

          <h3 class="subheading">Trivia</h3>
          <p>
            In Scandinavian folklore, Mylings (pronounced "mew-leeng") are ghosts of unwanted children killed by their parents. Because they were not baptized, Mylings cannot rest and are forced to roam until they can persuade a living being to carry them or their body to hallowed grounds where they can rest peacefully. Failure to carry a Myling in holy soil will cause him to kill his potential benefactor in rage. In-game, the Myling's age and ghost model are randomly chosen, and the ghost does not have to be of a young age.
            Another way that the Myling can find peace is if it can find and kill its mother. Usually it needs to be either carried by someone or get a form of "permission" to move/search from a relative in order to move from its burial place. This permission is usually obtained by trickery or vague wording of the request. They are usually depicted as small children in a early stage of decay (swollen and discoloured skin) but can choose to appear as adult if that was the age they would have been had they been alive.</p>

            „A Myling is a very vocal and active ghost. They are rumoured to be quiet when hunting their prey.”
