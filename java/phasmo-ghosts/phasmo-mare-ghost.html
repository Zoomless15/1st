          <h3 class="subheading">Trivia</h3>
          <p>
            In 0.3.1.0's Journal overhaul, the Mare's description was incorrectly changed to an old version where Mares caused hallucinations that dropped a person's sanity, which could be stopped by toggling one's flashlight. This feature was replaced with the current light-based hunt sanity threshold before early access release. Hallucinations that are not tied to one ghost will be added in a future update as part of the "Horror 2.0" overhaul.
            The Mare is based on the Scandinavian and Germanic mythological creature "Mara". The Mare in mythology was not technically a spirit but rather a normal woman that transformed at night due to a curse applied by circumstances of her birth. This curse applied to a man would instead create a Werewolf. The Mara would enter peoples homes at night and then place themself on their victims chest, making them paralyzed and giving them a feeling of suffocation. She was also responsible for nightmares and gave name to that phenomenon; Nightmare in English and Mardröm in Swedish. She also had a tendency to attack livestock making them exhausted and sickly. A sign that a Mare was active was that humans and animals attacked by her tended to get strange tangles and knots in their hair or fur. To drive off a Mare, one had to find its "mare tree" which was a specific tree the Mare had bound itself to, and could be identified by its tangled twigs (in reality, this is a phenomenon called "Witch's broom", and is caused by phytoplasmas). A twig from that tree, placed in the bed of the sufferer, would drive away the Mare. The Mare is usually depicted as a pale, gaunt woman with claw-like hands, long tangled hair and pale orb-like eyes. This of course does not apply to Phasmophobia; the ghost may take any appearance, including being male.</p>
